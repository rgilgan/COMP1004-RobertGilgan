                        Our charities work consists of raising money for purchases for the general public. This money will be for purchases the park's management
                        currently can't affort to buy. The Friends work together with the park management to promote use and development of the park.
                        An important purpose of our charity is to raise money for special projects and since our establishment in 1985, we have donated £300,000 to help
                        with support and maintainence of the house and park. <br /><br />

                        We regularly run fundraisers which are open to members and non-members alike. We also attend events where we can raise awareness of the charity and it's work. <br /><br />
