                Leaving Lambert Lodge, walk through the formal
                gardens to view items 1 – 5.
                Enter the <b>Italian Garden (1)</b> where the Friends have
                sponsored the bedding and the orange trees and
                funded the repairs to the statues on the Belvedere.
                Pass in front of the Orangery and on reaching the
                grass, cut across to enter the <b>
                    Golden Jubilee
                    Garden (2)
                </b> with its sound sculpture.
                Detour to the left to view the <b>Black Bee apiary (3)</b>
                and then retrace your steps to continue through
                the Silver Jubilee Garden.
                Turn left around the French conservatory into the
                <b>French Garden (4)</b> where the Friends have
                sponsored the bedding and repaired both the
                fountain and the conservatory.
                At the far end of the French Garden turn right and
                right again into the <b>Relic Garden (5)</b> which was
                totally funded by the Friends.
                After leaving the Relic Garden, turn left and left
                again to leave the formal gardens as indicated on
                the map.

                After visiting the Relic Garden continue through the
                hedge towards the sea and turn right, leaving the
                formal gardens.
                Continue across Barn Pool and pick up the coastal
                path towards the duck pond.
                At the duck pond, stay on the
                concrete track as it winds
                its way up through the
                amphitheatre, noticing
                <b>The New Trees (6)</b> that
                were planted in 2020.

                At the T-junction,
                for the short walk (1.25km),
                turn right and
                follow the path
                back up to the house
                where you can visit
                items 10 – 16.

                The <b>Barrow Centre (10)</b> was developed with help
                from the Friends and now houses retail outlets and
                The Farriers for food and drink.
                Take a look at the <b>Batcam (11)</b> which was funded
                by the Friends, as well as the <b>Fire Auxiliary (12)</b> and
                assorted memorabilia from old fire stations. When
                you have finished wandering around the Barrow
                Centre, leave in the direction of the house, passing
                the <b>Deer Garden (13)</b> on your way.
                Passing through the arch, turn right towards the
                house, through the <b>Knot Garden (14)</b>.
                If the house is open, visit the Earl’s Garden and look
                at the <b>Cedar Seat (15)</b> and <b>Shell Seat (16)</b>. Note:
                entrance fee payable except for members of the
                Friends.
                When you have finished, work your way back down
                the hill to <b>Lambert Lodge (17)</b>, passing the
                children’s play area by <b>Cremyll Gate (18)</b> which was
                built with the Friends’ help.
